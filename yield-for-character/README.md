# Yield for Character Parts

Usage:

Pass a Player's Character `Model` into `yieldForR15CharacterDescendants` or `yieldForR6CharacterDescendants`, which will yield via `yieldForTree` from `validate-tree` until all the members defined in the code exist (all members except those generated by Sound/Animate scripts). The function will return a promise, and, once these members exist, the model with all its members defined will be accessible through the `then` method.

```ts
yieldForR15CharacterDescendants(character).then(char => {
	// All members are properly typed and defined!
	char.Head.face.Texture = ""
});

// alternatively, one may use `await` inside an async function
async function f() {
	const char = await yieldForR15CharacterDescendants(character);
}
```
